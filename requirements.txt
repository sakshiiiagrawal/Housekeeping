🧹 Daily Housekeeping Room Assignment

🗓️ Objective
As the Housekeeping Manager, I need to assign available rooms for cleaning to the scheduled housekeeping teams every morning when I "open a day." The goal is to allocate rooms fairly and efficiently while respecting operational constraints.

✅ Inputs (Provided Daily)
Available Rooms List


A list of rooms that need to be cleaned that day. Each room includes:
Room number
Floor number
Credit value (workload)
Departure/stay status (optional but preferred)


Room-to-Floor Mapping


Each room is assigned to one of the 8 hotel floors.


Team Availability


A list of up to 11 teams scheduled for the day.


Fixed Room Assignments by Team


Each team has a predefined set of rooms they are trained or allowed to clean (“fixed zones”).


Room Credit Values


Every room has a numerical credit value based on cleaning effort.


Rooms with credit > 1 are considered suites.


Special Room Notes


Room 705 → can be assigned to any team


Room 702 + 708 → considered a combined single unit worth 4 credits


Room 310 + 312 → considered a combined single unit worth 2.5 credits



📌 Assignment Rules & Constraints
🔢 Team Credit Range
Every team must be assigned between 15.5 and 17 credits.


Credit totals must include all assigned rooms (fixed + non-fixed if needed).


🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team-Floor Limitations
A team can be assigned rooms on a maximum of 2 floors.


No more than 3 teams can be assigned to a single floor.


🧱 Room Assignment Rules
Prefer assigning each team rooms from their fixed zone.


If fixed rooms don’t provide at least 15.5 credits, allow assignment of non-fixed rooms to make up the minimum.


Each room can be assigned to only one team.


Room 705 is a wildcard and can be used to balance team credit.


⚖️ Zoning & Balance Guidelines
Try to keep teams within their usual zones.


Try to balance departures and suites so one team doesn’t get only heavy or only light rooms.


Where possible, favor assignments that keep teams on adjacent or nearby floors.



📤 Expected Output
A daily room assignment report, showing:
Each team’s name


The list of assigned rooms


Total credits per team


Floors covered by each team


This output will help:
Ensure cleaning workload is fairly distributed


Assist in performance tracking


Help supervisors oversee task distribution across floors
